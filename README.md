This project is part of the Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree coursework. 

A facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing key points on each face. Facial key points include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in applications such as face tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, emotion recognition, and biometrics.
